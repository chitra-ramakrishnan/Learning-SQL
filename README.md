Here, we have implemented all the possible SQL queries that one must know while working with SQL data-base particularly while fetching and cleaning the data before training any Machine Learning model.
### Following are the queries that we have implemented:
### 1. WHERE Clause
MySQL WHERE Clause is used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE clause to filter the results. It specifies a specific position where you have to do the operation.
### 2. Distinct Clause
MySQL DISTINCT clause is used to fetch only the unique records from the table. The DISTINCT clause is only used with the SELECT statement.
### 3. ORDER BY Clause
The MYSQL ORDER BY Clause is used to sort the records in ascending or descending order.
### 4. Group By Clause
The MYSQL GROUP BY Clause is used to collect data from multiple records and group the result by one or more column. It is generally used in a SELECT statement. You can also use some aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG etc. on the grouped column.
### 5. HAVING Clause
MySQL HAVING Clause : MySQL HAVING Clause is used with GROUP BY clause. It always returns the rows where condition is TRUE.
### 6. AND Condition
The MySQL AND condition is used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements to test two or more conditions in an individual query.
### 7. OR Condition
### 8. AND & OR Condition
### 9. Like
In MySQL, LIKE condition is used to perform pattern matching to find the correct result. It is used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statement with the combination of WHERE clause.
### 10. In Condition
The MySQL IN condition is used to reduce the use of multiple OR conditions in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statement.
### 11. IS NULL Condition
MySQL IS NULL condition is used to check if there is a NULL value in the expression. It is used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statement.
### 12. NOT NULL Condition
MySQL IS NOT NULL condition is used to check the NOT NULL value in the expression. It is used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements.
### 13. BETWEEN Condition
The MYSQL BETWEEN condition specifies how to retrieve values from an expression within a specific range. It is used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statement.
### ALTER Table :
MySQL ALTER statement is used when you want to change the name of your table or any table field. It is also used to add or delete an existing column in a table. The ALTER statement is always used with "ADD", "DROP" and "MODIFY" commands according to the situation. But these commands can easily be handled by pandas code. So, here we are not experimenting with ALTER TABLE commands. However, if we are working on a sole MySQL server then we can use ALTER TABLE commands to make any changes in table definition.
